    i heard a woman becomes herself
    the first time she speaks
    without permission
    then, every word out of her mouth
    a riot
    say, beautiful
    & point to the map of your body
    say, brave
    & wear your skin like a gown or a suit
    say, hero
    & cast yourself in the lead role
    ///
    when a girl pronounces her own name
    there is glory
    when a woman tells her own story
    she lives forever
    all the women i know are perennials—
    marigolds, daffodils
    soft things that refuse to die
    i don’t come from anything tamed or willing
    i come from soil flossed with barbed wire
    meaning, abuela would cuss you out
    with the same breath she kissed
    you with her blood
    a wild river
    my mother doesn’t rely on instruction manuals
    or men nor does she equate the two
    can fix anything
    if you get out of her way
    says the best technology
    is her own two hands
    
    ///
    
    but once, i dreamed I had no teeth
    
    just a mouth to hold
    other people’s things
    if this poem is the only thing that survives
    me
    tell them i grew a new tongue
    tell them i built me a throne
    tell them when we discovered life on another planet
    it was a woman
    & she built a bridge, not a border
    got god & named gravity
    after herself.`
